# PLC-Based Motor Control System with Photoelectric Sensors

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a PLC system that:
- Uses two photoelectric sensors
- Triggers a servo motor via a timer
- Stops a conveyor motor using a counter

The system was developed and tested using SoMachine software and a physical PLC setup.

## 🧪 Experiment Preparation

Before starting the experiment, preparatory work was conducted in the control laboratory:

- Analyzed system requirements and logical operations
- Designed and simulated the ladder diagram in SoMachine
- Verified proper functioning of timers, counters, and sensors in simulation
- Transferred the program to the physical PLC
- Connected and tested all components including:
  - XT218A1PCM12 & XUB5BPANL2 digital sensors
  - Servo and conveyor motors
  - Timer and counter modules

### ✅ Troubleshooting

During the hardware test phase, the following issues were identified and resolved:
- Sensor misalignment
- Timing synchronization delays
- Counter misreadings
